_Cyber-Frontier_ promised the world: a persistent open world, extraction mechanics, and battle royale intensity. Does it deliver?

## Visuals

Visually, it's stunning. The ray-traced neon streets and wet pavement look incredible on a 4090.

## Gameplay

Here is where it falls apart. The **netcode** is atrocious. We experienced rubber-banding in almost every firefight.

### Pros

- Incredible Art Direction
- Deep Weapon Customization

### Cons

- Server Stability
- Cheater Problem
- Expensive Microtransactions

**Score: 6/10**
