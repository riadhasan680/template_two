Season 12 brings a massive balance patch that has dethroned the long-time kings of the arena.

## Top Tier Legends

1.  **Valkyrie**: Still the queen of rotation. Her ult is indispensable for high-ranked play.
2.  **Newcastle**: With the buff to his shield deployment speed, he's now a top-tier support.
3.  **Horizon**: Verticality wins fights.

## Weapon Tier List

| Tier  | Weapon      | Notes                              |
| :---- | :---------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **S** | R-301       | Consistency is key.                |
| **A** | Peacekeeper | High risk, high reward.            |
| **B** | Flatline    | Harder recoil pattern this season. |

Don't sleep on the **Hemlok** this season; the burst fire buff makes it a mid-range monster.
