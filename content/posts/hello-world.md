Welcome to your new Hugo site! This is a sample post to demonstrate the **typography** and **styling** capabilities of the Tailwind CSS integration.

## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development without leaving your HTML. It's utility-first, meaning you compose complex designs from small, single-purpose classes.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Hugo!");
```

### List Example

- Fast build times
- Modern design system
- Completely customizable

Enjoy building your new site!
